Disclaimer:
  Please, consult your chosen tube model manufacturer data sheet, especially, when you entered the Rload.
  Then the calculation provided is an estimation based on the assumption that Rload is not relatively small!
  Tubes are non-linear devices and current draw may change under a number of conditions!
  This calculation is provided in the hope of being useful as a reference only.
  Proceed with caution! This tool disclaims any responsibility from any intended or actual use and consequences of this calculation.
