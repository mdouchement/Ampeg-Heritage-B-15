Selected transformer voltage: 350-0-350
Diode Reverse Repetative Maximum (Vrrm) rating: 1.2kV
  -> We knock off 10% to allow for variation in mains voltage, and knock off another 10% to allow for the transformer voltage being high if loaded only lightly.
  -> The popular 1N4007 is rated for 1000V. Two 1N4007 in series can handle 2000v.

Disclaimer:
  Please, consult your chosen tube model manufacturer data sheet, especially, when you entered the Rload.
  Then the calculation provided is an estimation based on the assumption that Rload is not relatively small!
  Tubes are non-linear devices and current draw may change under a number of conditions!
  This calculation is provided in the hope of being useful as a reference only.
